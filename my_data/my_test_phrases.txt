his Parisian rebirth|32518
is your typical ` fish out of water ' story . You 've seen them a million times . Just one problem : Fish out of water usually die .|163593
it 's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum .|163608
his characters ' crises with seriousness and compassion|32537
it 's a sitcom without the snap-crackle .|163612
it 's a tad slow|163613
his distinctive ` blundering ' style|32543
it 's all wet|163620
it 's almost worth seeing because it 's so bad|163622
it 's also cold , grey , antiseptic and emotionally desiccated .|163623

his point of view|32575

it 's good ,|163649
it 's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre|163652
it 's heading|163653
it 's in French ( well , mostly ) with English subtitles|163655
his shticks|32583
it 's kinda dumb . And second , what 's with all the shooting ?|163660
his smart , edgy voice and waddling profile ( emphasized here ) accent the humor of Wilson 's plight , and that saves his pathos from drippiness .|32588

it 's nice to watch a movie that has n't been focus-grouped into tedium|163668

it may feel like a parody of the mellow , peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture|163868

I 've never seen ( a remake ) do anything as stomach-turning as the way Adam Sandler 's new movie rapes , pillages and incinerates Frank Capra 's classic ...|184585

I suspect that you 'll be as bored watching Morvern Callar as the characters are in it . If you go , pack your knitting needles .|184716
is superbly|53644
is that its dying , in this shower of black-and-white psychedelia , is quite beautiful|53646
I think even fans of Sandler 's comic taste may find it uninteresting|184719

If The Full Monty was a freshman fluke , Lucky Break is ( Cattaneo ) sophomore slump .|184793
If anything , see it for Karen Black , who camps up a storm as a fringe feminist conspiracy theorist named Dirty Dick .|184798
it 's an eye-opener .|53726
If ever a concept came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter , this is it . If ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it .|184800
it 's based on true events|53727
it 's better to go in knowing full well what 's going to happen , but willing to let the earnestness of its execution and skill of its cast take you down a familiar road with a few twists . Cynics need not apply|53731
If only it were|184804
it 's cliche to call the film ` refreshing ,|53736
If there ai n't none , you have a problem|184816
If there was any doubt that Peter O'Fallon did n't have an original bone in his body|184817
it 's equally hard to imagine anybody being able to tear their eyes away from the screen once it 's started|53747
it 's far from fresh-squeezed|53748
If they broke out into elaborate choreography|184821
it 's forgivable that the plot feels|53749
it 's like dying and going to celluloid heaven|53752
it 's more of the ` laughing at ' variety than the ` laughing with|53753

it 's never boring|53754
If you are into splatter movies , then you will probably have a reasonably good time with The Salton Sea .|184838
it 's too grounded in the reality of its characters to go over the edge . A touch of humor or an unexpected plot twist always pulls it back|53770
If you do n't laugh , flee|184842
it 's virtually its own Hollywood remake .|53775
If you recognize Zeus ( the dog from Snatch )|184848
it a suitable entry into the fest circuit|53777
it accumulates power and depth|53778
If you really want to understand what this story is really all about , you 're far better served by the source material .|184847
it belongs to Martin Scorsese|53784
it ca n't be dismissed as mindless|53785
Imagine a film that begins as a Seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of The Shining , The Thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s .|184858

Impostor does n't do much with its template , despite a remarkably strong cast .|184862
it coulda|53791
it cuts to the heart of American society in an unnerving way|53792
it comes to the characters and writing ... but works its way underneath the skin like few movies|53790
Impostor is opening today at a theater near you .|184865
In Praise of Love , the sort of bitter old crank who sits behind his light meter and harangues the supposed injustices of the artistic world-at-large|184868
In Praise of Love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that 's unfocused and tediously exasperating|184870
it does n't also keep us riveted to our seats|53798
In a 102-minute film , Aaliyah gets at most 20 minutes of screen time|184872
it far above|53809
it forces you to ponder anew what a movie can be|53810
In all the annals of the movies|184884
it goes deeper than that , to fundamental choices that include the complexity of the Catholic doctrine|53812
it includes segments of 12 songs at a reunion concert|53815
it interesting as a character study is the fact that the story is told from Paul 's perspective|53816
In gleefully , thumpingly hyperbolic terms , it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass , jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz .|184889
it intriguing , bizarre ,|53818
In his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter|184890
it intriguing , bizarre , Dogma-like in spots - and quite truthful ,|53820
In my own very humble opinion , In Praise of Love lacks even the most fragmented charms I have found in almost all of his previous works .|184895
it is a kind , unapologetic , sweetheart of a movie|53825
In old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , Ms . Shreve 's novel proved too difficult a text to ` lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast .|184897
In one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of Quentin Tarantino 's climactic shootout -- and Meat Loaf explodes|184899
In space , no one can hear you snore|184902
In spite of featuring a script credited to no fewer than five writers|184903
In spite of featuring a script credited to no fewer than five writers , apparently nobody here bothered to check it twice .|184904
In the not-too-distant future , movies like Ghost Ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds . Right now|184914
In this case zero|184919
it seems better , not just bigger|53857
it seems most likely that Broomfield 's interviewees , or even himself , will not be for much longer|53858
it seems so real because it does not attempt to filter out the complexity|53860
it somehow managed to make its way past my crappola radar and find a small place in my heart|53862
Initial strangeness|184938
Initial strangeness inexorably gives way to rote sentimentality and|184940
it succeeds|53868
Initial strangeness inexorably gives way to rote sentimentality and mystical tenderness becomes narrative expedience|184941
Initially|184943
Instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the X Games , we get a cinematic postcard that 's superficial and unrealized .|184947
it will do so in a way that does n't make you feel like a sucker|53878
Instead of trying to bust some blondes , ( Diggs ) should be probing why a guy with his talent ended up in a movie this bad .|184951
it will have an opinion to share|53879
it will just as likely make you weep|53880
itch|53886
Intermezzo strain|184959
Interminably bleak|184961
its Oscar-sweeping franchise predecessor|53893
its characters all the more touching for refusing to pity or memorialize themselves .|53903
its complexity . Nothing|53906
its conception|53907
Is it possible for a documentary|184982
its director could ever have dreamed|53910
its dying|53912
Is it possible for a documentary to be utterly entranced by its subject and still show virtually no understanding of it ?|184984
its dying , in this shower of black-and-white psychedelia|53914
its dying , in this shower of black-and-white psychedelia ,|53915
Is n't it a bit early in his career for director Barry Sonnenfeld to do a homage to himself ?|184988
Is n't it|184987
its dying , in this shower of black-and-white psychedelia , is quite beautiful|53916
its epic scope|53921
It 's 51 times better than this|184994
It 's Pauly Shore awful . Do n't say you were n't warned|184995
It 's a big idea , but|185004
its generalities|53933
its grand locations|53934
its impact|53936
its impact is all the greater beause director Zhang 's last film , the cuddly Shower , was a non-threatening multi-character piece centered around a public bath house|53937
It 's a brilliant , honest performance by Nicholson ,|185009
its inhabitants|53938
its loving yet unforgivingly inconsistent depiction|53940
its mark|53946
its meaning|53947
its overly comfortable trappings|53958
It 's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition .|185032
its own droll and|53961
its patchy construction|53963
its place|53965
It 's actually pretty funny , but in all the wrong places|185041
its rapid-fire delivery|53970
It 's actually too sincere|185043
its relentless , polished wit can withstand not only inept school productions , but even Oliver Parker 's movie adaptation|53972
its script is not|53975
It 's all arty and jazzy|185047
It 's all surface psychodramatics .|185052
its specific story|53985
its star , Jean Reno , who resembles Sly Stallone in a hot sake half-sleep|53991
It 's as if Solondz had two ideas for two movies , could n't really figure out how to flesh either out , so he just slopped 'em together here .|185064
its sweeping battle scenes|53995
its visual delights|54004
its worst harangues|54006
its worst harangues are easy to swallow thanks to remarkable performances by Ferrera and Ontiveros|54007
itself beautifully to filming the teeming life on the reefs , making this gorgeous film a must for everyone from junior scientists to grown-up fish lovers|54008
It 's better suited for the history or biography channel , but|185081

journalistic work|54028
It 's difficult for a longtime admirer of his work to not be swept up in Invincible and overlook its drawbacks .|185101
journalistic work that draws a picture of a man for whom political expedience became a deadly foreign policy|54029
journey through life|54030
juggling|54032
junior scientists|54036
just a simple fable done in an artless sytle ,|54041
It 's hard to believe that a relationship like Holly and Marina 's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive .|185116
It 's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress .|185118
just as|54046
It 's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread .|185120
It 's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles|185122
It 's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles ,|185123
just enough to keep us on our toes|54052
It 's hard to say who might enjoy this , are there Tolstoy groupies out there ? It 's dark and tragic , and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death|185127
just kind of sits there and|54055
just kind of sits there and lets you look at this and its like you 're going from one room to the next and none of them have any relation to the other|54056
just that and it 's what makes their project so interesting|54059
It 's horribly depressing and not very well done .|185132
keep it|54061
It 's just plain boring .|185136
keep the audience riveted|54064
It 's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another .|185144
keep us riveted to our seats|54072
It 's like a drive-by . You can drive right by it without noticing anything special , save for a few comic turns , intended and otherwise .|185146
It 's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay .|185147
keeps the intensity of the film high , even as the strafings blend together|54078
It 's mindless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like Punch-Drunk Love .|185150

It 's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by Taylor 's cartoonish performance and the film 's ill-considered notion that Hitler 's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances|185195

It 's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the Cannes Film Festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere .|185197

la cabeza , pero de que entretiene|54132
It 's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even Jason X ... look positively Shakesperean by comparison .|185208

It could have been something special , but|185261
It dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum .|185264

It follows the Blair Witch formula for an hour , in which we 're told something creepy and vague is in the works ,|185278

It looks much more like a cartoon in the end than The Simpsons ever has .|185311

It makes even Elizabeth Hurley seem graceless and ugly .|185313
like a documentary in the way|54243
like a well-made PB & J sandwich|54247
It never comes close to being either funny or scary .|185325

It reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump|185332
like the nightmare you had a week ago that wo n't go away|54264
It shares the first two films ' loose-jointed structure , but|185337
It should be doing a lot of things , but does n't .|185340
It sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that 's more or less how it plays out|185350

Its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie 's presentation , which is way too stagy .|185386
Its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up .|185393

The power of this script|69844
The powerful success of Read My Lips with such provocative material shows why , after only three films , director\/co-writer Jacques Audiard , though little known in this country , belongs in the very top rank of French filmmakers .|69847
he comes across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited , and|200922
he could make with a decent budget|200924
he could n't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident|200925

The riveting performances by the incredibly flexible cast make Love a joy to behold .|69876
he seems embarrassed to be part of|200951
The screenplay never lets us forget that Bourne was once an amoral assassin just like the ones who are pursuing him ... There is never really a true '' us '' versus '' them ''|69880
The script|69885
he wants you to feel something|200958
The script by David Koepp is perfectly serviceable and because he gives the story some soul ... he elevates the experience to a more mythic level|69889
The script is smart and dark - hallelujah for small favors .|69891

The story has some nice twists but the ending and some of the back-story is a little tired . The performances are all solid ; it merely lacks originality to make it a great movie .|69939
The story is a rather simplistic one : grief drives her , love drives him , and a second chance to find love in the most unlikely place|69940

a predictably efficient piece of business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness , for an eagerness to create images you wish you had n't seen ,|72171

a psycho|72194
a rainbow|72204

is one baaaaaaaaad movie .|203279
is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another . About half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal .|203284

is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the DV revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film|203344
is rather unexceptional|203347
a retooled genre piece , the tale of a guy and his gun|72277
a return to form for director Peter Bogdanovich|72278
is really a series of strung-together moments , with all the spaces in between filled with fantasies , daydreams , memories and one fantastic visual trope after another|203352

a smart , funny look at an arcane area of popular culture|72432

is to see two Academy Award winning actresses ( and one Academy Award winning actor ) succumb to appearing in this junk that 's TV sitcom material at best|203598

the odd distinction of being playful without being fun|215234

is filled with humorous observations about the general absurdity of modern life as seen through the eyes outsiders|84204
the original short story but this movie|215279
is fluid and quick .|84210
is for Roman Polanski|84211

the original was not|215283
the original was released in 1987 ...|215285
the other side of the bra|215287
the original version ( no more racist portraits of Indians , for instance )|215282

the performer|215340

the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business|215343
the perverse pleasure of watching Disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel|215346
is haunting ...|84276
the pieces do n't quite fit together|215353
is hilarious as she tries to resuscitate the fun-loving libertine lost somewhere inside the conservative , handbag-clutching Sarandon .|84285
the pilot episode of a new teen-targeted action TV series|215357
is his best film yet|84289
is historical|84291
the plot `|215367

is how well it holds up in an era in which computer-generated images are the norm|84297
the plot ` surprises '|215369
the plot is both contrived and cliched|215373
the point of real interest -|215378
is in his hypermasculine element here|84307
is in his hypermasculine element here ,|84308
is in his element here|84306
the point of suffocation|215384
is in its examination of America 's culture of fear as a root cause of gun violence .|84314
the possibility of creating a more darkly|215392
the pre-teen crowd|215403
is its utter sincerity .|84335
the present Hollywood program|215408
is just as good , if not better than much of what 's on Saturday morning TV especially the pseudo-educational stuff we all ca n't stand|84337
is just as much about the ownership and redefinition of myth as it is about a domestic unit finding their way to joy .|84340
is less baroque and showy than Hannibal , and less emotionally affecting than Silence|84352
the producers|215425
the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing|215424
is lightweight filmmaking ,|84355
is like a 1940s Warner Bros . B picture|84357
is like a progressive bull in a china shop , a provocateur crashing into ideas and special-interest groups as he slaps together his own brand of liberalism|84358
is little question that this is a serious work by an important director who has something new to say about how , in the flip-flop of courtship , we often reel in when we should be playing out .|84364
is love|84365
is made available to American workers|84366
the promise of a reprieve|215439
is made fresh by an intelligent screenplay and gripping performances in this low-budget , video-shot , debut indie effort|84367
is moody , oozing , chilling and heart-warming all at once|84378
the pun|215453
the raising|215457
is more appetizing than a side dish of asparagus . If you 're not a fan , it might be like trying to eat Brussels sprouts|84388
is more complex and honest|84390
is more complex and honest than anything represented in a Hollywood film|84391
the relationship between Yosuke and Saeko is worth watching as it develops|215465
is more fascinating -- being real -- than anything seen on Jerry Springer .|84397
is more fun than Conan the Barbarian .|84399
is more than tattoo deep|84403
the resonant|215476
the rest of it|215482
is moving|84412
the rest of us , sitting through Dahmer 's two hours amounts to little more than punishment|215485
the result is disappointing|215487
is n't as funny as you 'd hoped .|84428
the right frame of mind|215502
is n't blind to the silliness ,|84431
the right parts|215504
is n't fake fun|84437
is n't going to make box office money that makes Michael Jordan jealous|84439
the rollicking dark humor so necessary|215512
the romance with Ryder|215514
the romantic angle|215516
is n't subversive|84444
is n't trying simply to out-shock , out-outrage or out-depress its potential audience ! Who knew|84450
the ruthless social order that governs college cliques|215523
is n't very interesting actually|84452
is needed to live a rich and full life .|84454
is never less than|84455
is never less than engaging|84456
the same easy targets|215529
the same blueprint|215528
is nevertheless maintained throughout|84459
is nicely|84460
the same illogical things|215533
the same mistake|215535
the same mistake as the music industry|215536
is no denying the power of Polanski 's film ...|84465
the same number of continuity errors|215538
the same old bad trip|215539
is no cinematic sin|84463
is nonjudgmental|84469
is not a love letter for the slain rappers|84474
is not a movie about an inhuman monster|84475
the same way you came|215547
the satire|215552
is not an out of place metaphor|84481
is not quite the career peak|84490
the screenwriter|215564
the screenwriter and director Michel Gondry|215566
the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year|215568
is nothing short of a great one .|84497
is now outselling the electric guitar|84498
is of course the point|84501
is one adapted - from-television movie that actually looks as if it belongs on the big screen .|84505
the script gives him little to effectively probe Lear 's soul-stripping breakdown .|215578
is one of the rarest kinds of films : a family-oriented non-Disney film that is actually funny without hitting below the belt|84510
the sensuality|215583
is one of the year 's best|84512
the sentimental oh-those-wacky-Brits genre|215585
is one of the year 's best films .|84514
the service of such a minute idea|215589
is one of those films that aims to confuse .|84518
the setup|215591
the shallow sensationalism characteristic|215597
the shallow sensationalism characteristic of soap opera|215598
is painterly .|84527
the sheer ugliness|215600
the sheets|215602
the show 's concept|215605
is philosophy , illustrated through everyday events|84539
the simpering soundtrack|215612
is playful but highly studied and dependent for its success on a patient viewer .|84542
is pleasingly emphatic in this properly intense , claustrophobic tale of obsessive love|84543
is predictable in the reassuring manner of a beautifully sung holiday carol|84549
the sketchiest of captions|215624
the sky|215625

is robbed and replaced with a persecuted '' other|84582
the special spark between the characters that made the first film such a delight|215655
the spawn|215653
the speculative effort|215657
the speculative effort is hampered by Taylor 's cartoonish performance and the film 's ill-considered notion that Hitler 's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances|215658
the spice of specificity|215659
is rote work and predictable , but with a philosophical visual coming right at the end that extravagantly redeems it|84587
the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place .|215667
the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life|215669
the stars seem to be in two different movies|215670
is shifty in the manner in which it addresses current terrorism anxieties and sidesteps them at the same time .|84599
is shockingly devoid of your typical Majid Majidi shoe-loving , crippled children .|84601
the stops|215674
is silly but strangely believable .|84603
the stories and faces and|215676
the story 's center|215678
is simple but absorbing .|84606
the story and the somewhat predictable plot|215682
the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible Anne Rice novel it 's based upon|215685
is smart writing , skewed characters , and the title performance by Kieran Culkin|84614
is smart writing , skewed characters , and the title performance by Kieran Culkin .|84615
the story to show us why it 's compelling|215689
is so convincing that by movies ' end you 'll swear you are wet in some places and feel sand creeping in others .|84618
the story would n't work without all those gimmicks|215691
is so darned assured|84619
is so different from The Apple and so striking that it can only encourage us to see Samira Makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility , working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success|84621

the storytelling and less|215700

is so intimate and sensual and funny and psychologically self-revealing that it makes most of what passes for sex in the movies look like cheap hysterics|84628
the stunts in The Tuxedo seem tired and , what 's worse , routine|215703
the subject matter goes nowhere .|215707
the superficially written characters ramble|215719
the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art|215720

the supernatural trappings only obscure the message|215722

there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue .|216158

is one of those films that I wanted to like much more than I actually did|232693
is one of those reputedly `` unfilmable '' novels that has bucked the odds to emerge as an exquisite motion picture in its own right .|232696
is paced at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age and deathly slow to any teen|232702
's awfully entertaining to watch|101634
is poised for titillation , raw insight or both .|232707
's become one of the movies ' creepiest conventions , in which the developmentally disabled|101640

is really an amusing concept|232722

's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long|101661
is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting .|232734
is slow to those of us|232735
's definitely a step in the right direction|101666
is so cool that it chills the characters , reducing our emotional stake in the outcome of `` Intacto 's '' dangerous and seductively stylish game .|232739
is so insanely stupid , so awful in so many ways that watching it leaves you giddy|232744
is solid meat-and-potatoes filmmaking|232747

's insecure in Lovely and Amazing , a poignant and wryly amusing film about mothers , daughters and their relationships|101715
is that it progresses in such a low-key manner that it risks monotony .|232787
's just impossible not to feel nostalgia for movies you grew up with|101722
is that they 're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders .|232794
is the `` Gadzooks|232796
is the best little `` horror '' movie I 've seen in years|232797
's just not very smart|101724

is the picture of health with boundless energy until a few days before she dies .|232817
's lovely that Cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his picture-perfect life|101746
is the script 's endless assault of embarrassingly ham-fisted sex jokes that reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a `` cooler '' PG-13 rating .|232820
's more repetition than creativity throughout the movie|101756
is they have a tendency to slip into hokum .|232830

's no denying that Burns is a filmmaker with a bright future ahead of him|101772

's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish|101854

it 's as though clips from The Pink Panther Strikes Again and\/or Sailor Moon have been spliced in .|232933

it 's not wallowing in hormonal melodrama|232961
's sincere to a fault , but , unfortunately , not very compelling or much fun|101894

is n't nearly as downbeat as it sounds , but strikes a tone that 's alternately melancholic , hopeful and strangely funny|124297
is n't nearly as funny|124299
is n't one true ` Chan moment ' .|124302
is n't really about anything . When it 's this rich and luscious|124305

is n't very funny|124309
is n't world championship material|124310
is nearly incoherent|124312
is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout ... by which time it 's impossible to care who wins|124314
is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout ... by which time it 's impossible to care who wins .|124315
is nevertheless efficiently amusing|124323
is no sense .|124332
is not a stereotypical one of self-discovery ,|124339
is not easily|124344
is not only a love song to the movies|124347
is not really a film as much|124350
is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of not-so-funny gags , scattered moments of lazy humor .|124352
is not that it 's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes|124356
is not the perfect movie many have made it out to be|124362
is not unlike watching a glorified episode of '' 7th Heaven . ''|124365
is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from Stock Character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination|124367
is nothing compared to the movie 's contrived , lame screenplay and listless direction .|124370
is nothing short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy|124373
is nothing special|124376
is off-putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved|124382
is one of those films that possesses all the good intentions in the world , but ...|124405
is one of those rare docs that paints a grand picture of an era and makes the journey feel like a party|124406
is one of those war movies that focuses on human interaction rather than battle and action sequences|124410
is one-sided|124418
is only surface|124428
is only surface deep|124429
is oppressively heavy .|124431
is otherwise|124432
is overkill to the highest degree .|124435
is pretty diverting|124451
is pretty much the same all over|124452
is recommended only for those under 20 years of age|124463
is relatively short|124464
is remarkably dull with only Caine making much of an impression|124467
is repellantly out of control|124472
is revealing|124477
is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary .|124483
is shrewd enough to activate girlish tear ducts does n't mean it 's good enough for our girls .|124486
is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount|124487
is simply a matter of ( being ) in a shrugging mood .|124489
is simply a well-made and satisfying thriller|124490
is sketchy with actorish notations on the margin of acting|124497
is smart and entirely charming in intent and execution .|124505
is smarter and subtler than ( Total Recall and Blade Runner ) , although its plot may prove too convoluted for fun-seeking summer audiences|124508
is so bleak|124511
is so bleak that it 's hardly watchable|124512
is so cool that it chills the characters , reducing our emotional stake in the outcome of '' Intacto 's '' dangerous and seductively stylish game|124520
is so cool that it chills the characters , reducing our emotional stake in the outcome of '' Intacto 's '' dangerous and seductively stylish game .|124521
is so grainy and rough , so dependent on being ` naturalistic ' rather than carefully lit and set up , that it 's exhausting to watch .|124531
is so insanely dysfunctional|124532
is so meditative and lyrical about Babak Payami 's boldly quirky Iranian drama Secret Ballot ... a charming and evoking little ditty that manages to show the gentle and humane side of Middle Eastern world politics|124538
is so much|124539
is so much plodding sensitivity .|124541
is so often less|124542
is something of a stiff -- an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes .|124565
is somewhat problematic|124568
is spooky and subtly in love with myth|124571
is spot|124572
is struck less by its lavish grandeur than by its intimacy and precision .|124582
is technically sophisticated in the worst way|124591
is that Caruso takes an atypically hypnotic approach to a world that 's often handled in fast-edit , hopped-up fashion|124601
is that Caruso takes an atypically hypnotic approach to a world that 's often handled in fast-edit , hopped-up fashion .|124602
is that Hollywood expects people to pay to see it|124604
is that I ca n't wait to see what the director does next .|124607
is that he can actually trick you into thinking some of this worn-out , pandering palaver is actually funny|124611
is that heavyweights Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis agreed to produce this|124612
is that it 's a rock-solid little genre picture . Whether you like it or not is basically a matter of taste .|124615
is that it 's actually watchable . Even more baffling is that it 's funny|124616
is that it 's shot on digital video , whose tiny camera enables Shafer to navigate spaces both large ... and small ... with considerable aplomb|124620
is that it does have a few cute moments .|124627
is that it stinks|124635
is that she never lets her character become a caricature -- not even with that radioactive hair|124641
is that the entire exercise has no real point|124645
is that there is no rest period , no timeout|124648
is that there is nothing in it to engage children emotionally|124649
is the audience for Cletis Tout ?|124654
is the director 's epitaph for himself|124669
is the drama within the drama|124670
is the far superior film|124676
is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness .|124682
is the parade of veteran painters , confounded dealers , and miscellaneous bohos who expound upon the subject 's mysterious personality without ever explaining him .|124691
is the score ,|124697
is the sort of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video -- with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes .|124700
is the stuff|124701
is the way that it treats conspiracy as a kind of political Blair Witch , a monstrous murk that haunts us precisely because it can never be seen .|124707
is to market the charismatic Jackie Chan to even younger audiences|124714
is to win over the two-drink-minimum crowd|124715
is too crazy|124718
is too cute by half|124720
is too heady for children , and too preachy for adults|124723
is too pedestrian a filmmaker to bring any edge or personality to The Rising Place that would set it apart from other Deep South stories|124728
is too upbeat|124734
is truly funny|124737
is ultimately quite unengaging|124738
is ultimately what makes Shanghai Ghetto move beyond a good , dry , reliable textbook and what allows it to rank with its worthy predecessors .|124741
is unashamedly pro-Serbian and|124744
is unashamedly pro-Serbian and makes little attempt to give voice to the other side .|124746
is uncompromising , difficult and unbearably beautiful|124747
is uncompromising , difficult and unbearably beautiful .|124748
is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed|124753
is visually smart ,|124759
is wasted in this crass , low-wattage endeavor .|124762
is well below expectations .|124764
is worth seeking .|124773
is worthy of our respect|124779
it 's Black Hawk Down with more heart . At its worst , it 's Rambo - meets-John Ford .|124786
it 's Rambo - meets-John Ford|124790
it 's a heck of a ride . Samuel L . Jackson is one of the best actors there is|124795
it 's a pale imitation|124800
it 's a wacky and inspired little film that works effortlessly at delivering genuine , acerbic laughs .|124805
it 's a work that , with humor , warmth , and intelligence , captures a life interestingly lived|124806
it 's also one of the smartest|124814
it 's an adventure story and history lesson all in one .|124816
it 's clear that Washington most certainly has a new career ahead of him|124823
it 's good enough|124831
it 's hardly over before it begins to fade from memory|124834
it 's hardly watchable|124835
it 's icky .|124836
it 's impossible to ascertain whether the film is , at its core , deeply pessimistic or quietly hopeful .|124837
it 's impossible to care|124838
it 's more than a worthwhile effort|124848
it 's not all new|124849
it 's not half-bad|124853
it 's not very good either .|124857
it 's so muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through|124869
it 's so poorly made , on all levels , that it does n't even qualify as a spoof of such|124870
it 's telling that his funniest moment comes when he falls about ten feet onto his head|124878
it 's waltzed itself into the art film pantheon .|124886
it , no wiseacre crackle or hard-bitten cynicism|124895
it . No ,|124900
it a Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade balloon|124903
it all . Jackass is a vulgar and|124912
it already has one strike against it .|124915
it also is more fully an example of the kind of lush , all-enveloping movie experience it rhapsodizes|124918
it arrives|124921
it begins to seem as long as the two year affair which is its subject|124926
it breathes more on the big screen and induces headaches more slowly|124927
it can make him a problematic documentary subject|124932
it certainly got lost in the '' soon-to-be-forgettable '' section of the quirky rip-off prison romp pile .|124934
it comes off as only occasionally satirical and never fresh .|124939
it does n't even seem like she tried|124961
it ends in a rush of sequins , flashbulbs , blaring brass and back-stabbing babes|124962
it eventually pays off and is effective if you stick with it|124965
it fails to get|124967
it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time|124969
it feels accidental|124971
it feels like unrealized potential|124974
it has a screenplay written by Antwone Fisher based on the book by Antwone Fisher|124988
it has said plenty about how show business has infiltrated every corner of society -- and not always for the better .|124991
it has you study them|124992
it is a good and ambitious film .|124998
it is an engaging nostalgia piece .|125008
it is being dubbed|125011
it is does not rely on dumb gags , anatomical humor , or character cliches|125013
it is handled with intelligence and care|125017
it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why|125018
it is interesting to witness the conflict from the Palestinian side|125022
it is n't even close to being the barn-burningly bad movie it promised it would be|125026
it is not what is on the screen|125028
it is were it not for the striking , quietly vulnerable personality of Ms . Ambrose|125038
it just enough|125040
it just seems like it does . My only wish is that Celebi could take me back to a time before I saw this movie and I could just skip it .|125041
it leaves you giddy . Half Past Dead|125043
it may leave you feeling a little sticky and unsatisfied|125053
it might work better . But it has an ambition to say something about its subjects , but not a willingness|125057
it misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche .|125059
it necessary to hide new secretions from the parental units|125062
it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it|125063
it offers large rewards|125067
it plays like a reading from Bartlett 's Familiar Quotations|125070
it poses for itself that one can forgive the film its flaws|125072
it progresses in such a low-key manner that it risks monotony . But it 's worth the concentration|125075
it promised it would be|125076
it rarely achieves its best|125080
it rhapsodizes|125086
it seem , is not a hobby that attracts the young and fit .|125095
it sounds , but strikes a tone that 's alternately melancholic , hopeful and strangely funny|125101
it to be better and more successful than it is|125115
it wanted to fully capitalize on its lead 's specific gifts|125130
it will warm your heart , and|125147
